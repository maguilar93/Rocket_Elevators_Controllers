# Rocket_Elevators_Controllers

This repository contains:
_ the algorithms for the New Rocket Elevator Solutions for both Residential and Commercial offers
_ the Python version of the algorithm for the Residential offer \* the Javscript version of the algorithm for the Residential offer

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js
- Python

### Instructions

In order to use the Python and Javascript versions, it is important to create the two elevators with their main positions.

```
For Python:

elevator_1 = Elevator(position, id)
elevator_2 = Elevator(position, id)
```

```
For Javascript:

let elevator_1 = new Elevator(position, id);
let elevator_2 = new Elevator(position, id);
```
